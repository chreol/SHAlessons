EN Javascript:
.Replace

pour remplacer des coma par des space, nous utilisons la fonction
.replace, it wrtite .replace(/,/g," "), you can add this to a string
and you will get a result you need.

eg: 
let thisTest = (This,is,my,first,extra,revision,in,javascript);
how can we remove the coma'a and read easily.
just write in our console
thisTest = myString.replace(/,/g," ");
done, to check it just console.log and see.
console.log(thisTest);
"tahn tahdn" on screen we have a sentense.
(This is my firstextra revision in javascript)

this was .replace function.

.SPLICE
This function can add or remove items inside arrays or string.
let us check on to add and item in the array

let dayOfTheWeek = ['monday', 'tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'friday', 'saturday', 'sunday']
console.log(dayOfTheWeek);
["monday", "tuesday", "Wednesday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday"]
oupps i forgot to write thursday in my array, if i just use 
.splice ((where to push it), 0, (what to push on that right place));

solve that:
dayOfTheWeek.splice(3,0,"thursday");
console.log(dayOfTheWeek);
["monday", "tuesday", "Wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday"]
